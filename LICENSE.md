### 1. License Grant

The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative
works, redistribute, and make use of the Licensed Work, subject to the
conditions set forth below.

You may make use of the Licensed Work for **non-commercial purposes**,
including personal, academic, or internal evaluation usage.

Commercial use of the Licensed Work is permitted **only if it does not**
(a) create or distribute a product or service that competes directly with the
Licensed Work or any substantially similar functionality developed by the
Licensor; or
(b) redistribute, repackage, or publicly upload the Licensed Work or any
substantial part thereof in its original or minimally modified form,
including but not limited to publishing binaries, installers, or repositories

### 1.1 Definition of Competing Products

For the purpose of this License, a *competing product or service* is defined
as any software, application, or tool that provides functionality that
**substantially overlaps** with the Licensed Work, including but not limited
to tools of the same category or intended use, **with at least three (3)**
modules, components, or major features functionally identical or equivalent
to those in the Licensed Work or in any other software developed by the
Licensor.

Substantial overlap may also be determined by **high similarity in user
interface structure**, user interaction flow, or visual layout that causes
the end-user experience to be materially indistinguishable from that of the
Licensed Work.

### 1.2 Revocation and Reinstatement of License

If the Licensor determines, in good faith and based on reasonable evidence,
that any individual or entity has used the Licensed Work to create, distribute,
or commercially exploit a product or service that qualifies as a competing
work as defined in Section 1.1, or has otherwise breached the conditions of
this License (including unauthorized repackaging or public redistribution),
the Licensor may, upon written notice, **revoke the rights granted to that
party under this License**.

Upon revocation, the offending party must immediately cease all use,
distribution, and public availability of the Licensed Work and any derivative
thereof until explicit written reinstatement from the Licensor.

In cases where evidence of a potential breach or competitive activity is
inconclusive, the Licensor reserves the right to **temporarily suspend the
license** for further review.

The Licensor’s good-faith determination under this section shall be final and
binding for the purpose of license enforcement.

#### Reinstatement Clause

A party whose license has been revoked under this section may, within
**thirty (30) days** of receiving notice of revocation, submit a written
statement and evidence of corrective action demonstrating compliance with
the License terms. The Licensor may, at its sole discretion, reinstate the
license upon satisfactory review of the corrective measures.

Failure to remedy or respond within the specified period will result in the
revocation becoming **permanent**.
